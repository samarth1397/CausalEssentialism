In this task you will be shown 18 images. Along with each image you will be provided with a list of eight or nine features which may or may not be relevant to the image and the category. You have to rate (on a scale of 1 to 7) how appropriate each feature is to the particular image and the category in general. On the scale, 1 denotes that the feature almost certainly does not apply to the image while 7 indicates that it almost certainly does.

</center>
<br><br>For instance, for the image shown above, a "1" feature might be "has green skin", a "7" feature might be "has a head" and a "4" feature might be "is happy", because this baby might or might not be happy  (itâ€™s hard to tell). For some of the images all of the features may apply and for some only a few might; either is fine. We are looking for your gut intuitions so please don't overthink any of them, but try to pay attention to each one."
