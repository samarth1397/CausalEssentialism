All done! Before we move on to other questions, the first step is to report on all of the English words you saw in the text box below. Don't worry about getting the order right, and separate them with semicolons but no spaces. For instance, if you saw <em>apricot</em>, <em>dinosaur</em>, and <em>lollipop</em>, you should enter <em>apricot;dinosaur;lollipop</em> in the box. <br><br>
