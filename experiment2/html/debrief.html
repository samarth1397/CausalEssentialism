The study was pretty straightforward so there’s not much more to say, but in case you’re interested in
more of the background, here it is: <br><br>

As we mentioned at the beginning of this experiment, we are interested in understanding how people
think about familiar categories. A lot is known about how those categories are represented in general
(e.g., what features dogs in general have, how you can interact with them, etc). Much less is known
about the extent to which those features are perceived to vary among particular instances of these
categories. We know that not all dogs are brown, but most dogs have four legs, but we don’t have
precise measurements for “not all” or “most”, and we don’t know how different features correlate
with each other. This study is a first attempt at gathering this data. Using a large database of images
of common categories that range in typicality, we gave each of you one image for each category and
had you rate what you thought about that image.<br><br>

We expect this data will have many uses, but our most immediate project is to explore whether the
internal category structure predicts the tendency to ‘essentialise’ those categories. Essentialised
categories are those that people perceive their being an internal essence, or cause, that makes them
that way: for instance, most people view dogs as having an internal ‘dog’ essence, so even if you
changed its surface form dramatically (e.g., shaving it, cutting off its legs L etc) it would still be a
dog. Other categories, like tables, are generally not seen as having essences: if you cut all of the legs
off a table and chopped it into bits, it would no longer be a table. Our hypothesis is that the features of
items in essentialized correlate much more highly with each other, and that this licenses the inference
of a hidden cause. We will test this by taking the data about the features you have given us and
feeding it into a computational model that learns about hidden causal structure, and testing whether
different categories license different causal structures. <br><br>

Essentialism is a very interesting cognitive phenomenon, and if you are interested in learning more,
the article below is a good starting point:

As always we are very grateful to the thoughtful data you provide, as it tells us a great deal about how
humans think and reason.<br><br>
