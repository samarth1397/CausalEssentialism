# CausalEssentialism

### About
R-scripts which were used to compare the likelihood of various causal structures. This was part of my undergraduate thesis. This work was completed at the Computational Cognitive Science Laboratory, University of Melbourne.

### Hypothesis and Motivation

Representations of categories consist of a hidden essence which is causally responsible for surface features (psychological essentialism). The aim of the project was to explore whether the perceptual features associated with natural categories support the inference of hidden causes.

### Data
Data was collected from human participants using two experiments which were conducted using Amazon Mechanical Turk.
